Hi, I’m @RTI-01.

I’m interested in blockchain, hybrid p2p networking, and grid computing technologies.

I’m currently learning about the Hypercore Protocol and Algorand's blockchain technologies.

I’m looking to collaborate on building the Renaissance DSAO, a large-scale project.

## Renaissance DSAO

Renaissance DSAO intends to develop a purposeful, federated and distributed compute, 
content development and content delivery network and platform, one specifically made to revolutionize STEM education, credentialling & equivalency recognition, research & innovation funding,and professional standards development.

The mission of Renaissance DSAO is to innovate technologies and delivery models for amplification of STEM education, workforce development, and research & innovation capacity and impact, towards elevating the basic human condition across the developing and developed world.

Renaissance DSAO’s network and platform is being made possible by innovation in blockchain, hybrid p2p networking and grid computing technologies.
